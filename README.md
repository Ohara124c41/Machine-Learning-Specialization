## Synopsis

At the top of the file there should be a short introduction and/ or overview that explains **what** the project is. This description should match descriptions added for package managers (Gemspec, package.json, etc.)

## Code Example

Show what the library does as concisely as possible, developers should be able to figure out **how** your project solves their problem by looking at the code example. Make sure the API you are showing off is obvious, and that your code is short and concise.

## Motivation

A short description of the motivation behind the creation and maintenance of the project. This should explain **why** the project exists.

## Installation

Most of the projects are initialized to work with GraphLab. I recommend using -pip install on Conda, so you do not need to initialize the desktop version of GraphLab. Numpy also has packages that can are suitable. For some of the mapping techniques, R can be used as well (e.g. Euclidean/Cosine Distance between two vectors).

## Tests

Describe and show how to run the tests with code examples.

## Contributors
