## Synopsis

Enclosed are the lectures, projects and addtional information resources that contained within the Machine Learning Specialization program. The information contained in the lecture slides is more than sufficient to learn how to approach the projects (which is more than can be said for most Specializations or MicroMasters...). You could then follow along with the notebooks and should be able to fully understand the logical steps taken to receive the solutions. 

## Motivation

This specialization was selected as supplemental information for graduate studies in Robotics and Artificial Intelligence, as well as an interesting Life-Long Learning topic. The various projects granted additional familiarity using Jupyter Notebooks, learning GraphLab, as well as some more specialized mathematical principles in statistics and probability. Many of the topics involved are directly related to AI and Robotics, so if you have an interest in these topics, I highly recommend pursuing this specialization. 

## Installation

All of the projects are initialized to work with GraphLab. I recommend using -pip install on Conda, so you do not need to initialize the desktop version of GraphLab. Numpy also has packages that can are suitable. For some of the techniques, R can be used as well (e.g. Euclidean/Cosine Distance between two vectors) or MatLab.

## Tests

All of the projects can be ran and tested within the cells of Juypter Notebooks.

## Contributors
